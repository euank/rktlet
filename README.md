# rktlet - The rkt implemntation of a Kubernetes Container Runtime

The rktlet repository contains design and code related to letting the Kubelet run contains with the rkt container runtime.

The work in this repository is meant to eventually supplant the [rkt package](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/v1.3.0/pkg/kubelet/rkt/) in the main Kubernetes repository.

## Current Status

Currently the project is under design and development of the next iteration of integration between rkt and the Kubelet.
However, the current functional integration of rkt into Kubernetes lives in the above kubelet package, not here.
